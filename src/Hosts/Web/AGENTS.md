## Icon conventions

- **[MUST]** Render interface icons using Font Awesome CSS classes. The icon name must be recognizable directly from the JSX, for example `fa-light fa-users`.
- **[MUST]** Do not embed `<svg>`, `<path>`, copied path data, or SVG-based icon components for interface icons.
- Use `FaIcon` from `@vitarish/web-ui` when its shared behavior is useful; otherwise, a plain semantic `<i>` with Font Awesome classes is acceptable.
- SVG remains allowed for non-icon artwork such as logos, illustrations, diagrams, and data visualizations.
- Decorative icons must be hidden from assistive technology. Icon-only controls must have an accessible label.

## Button conventions

- **[MUST]** All buttons must have localized tooltips and icons. so in mobile view they can be shrunk to icon and tooltips to avoid confusing users.
