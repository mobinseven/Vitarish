# AGENTS.md — Architecture Rules

These rules are non-negotiable. Every artifact you produce must comply. No exceptions, no shortcuts, no "it's just a small thing."

---

## What "Artifact" Means

Every unit you touch: solution, project, namespace, class, struct, record, interface, enum, method, function, service, repository, controller, handler, command, query, DTO, entity, event, migration, config, test, adapter, port, or integration boundary.

---

## The Ten Rules

**1. One responsibility per artifact.**
One reason to change. If it mixes business logic, persistence, validation, orchestration, transport, or UI — split it now.

**2. One active state model.**
No duplicated domain concepts, no parallel truth sources. If two models exist, define their boundary and mapping explicitly.

**3. Minimize inter-component knowledge.**
Components know only what they directly need. No reaching through object graphs. No leaking internals, persistence details, or framework specifics.

**4. Depend on abstractions, not implementations.**
Core logic depends on stable contracts only. Never on databases, HTTP clients, filesystems, vendor SDKs, clocks, or UI details.

**5. Commands change state. Queries return data. Never both.**
A method that changes state must not return data as a query API. A method that returns data must not change observable state.

**6. Validate all inputs. Handle all failures explicitly.**
Invalid input, unavailable dependencies, partial failure, retries, idempotency, cancellation — handle them intentionally. Silent swallowing of exceptions is a defect.

**7. Extend through new code, not edits to stable code.**
New behavior goes in new implementations, strategies, handlers, or adapters. Do not repeatedly modify stable core logic to add features.

**8. Protect core logic from infrastructure.**
Domain and application logic must never import or reference UI, database, transport, framework, filesystem, network, clock, or third-party SDKs.

**9. Do not add what is not needed now.**
No speculative layers, no fashionable patterns, no generic frameworks built for imagined futures. If it doesn't solve a real present problem, remove it.

**10. One source of truth for every rule and value.**
Business rules, validation logic, state transitions, config values, and shared definitions exist in exactly one place. Duplication is a defect.

## Before You Write Anything

Classify each artifact:

- Domain / core logic
- Application / use-case orchestration
- Command (write)
- Query (read)
- Port / contract
- Adapter / infrastructure
- Presentation / API / UI
- Data transfer shape
- Persistence model
- Test
- Configuration / composition root

If an artifact fits more than one category, split it. No exceptions.

---

## Mandatory Steps

1. Identify the smallest set of artifacts required.
2. Assign exactly one responsibility to each.
3. Define boundaries: core → application → infrastructure → presentation.
4. Name the single source of truth for every piece of state.
5. Separate commands from queries.
6. Define abstractions before writing any infrastructure dependency.
7. Ask whether extensibility is needed *now* — not speculatively.
8. Remove every pattern, layer, and abstraction that serves no current requirement.
9. Only then write code.

---

## Hard Stops — Stop and Correct Immediately If:

- A class or method has more than one responsibility.
- A method both mutates state and serves as a query.
- Core logic imports or references infrastructure, frameworks, vendors, or UI.
- A business rule appears in more than one place.
- Two artifacts represent the same state without an explicit ownership boundary.
- A component accesses internals through another component.
- Adding a feature requires editing stable core logic when an extension point exists.
- An error is swallowed, ignored, or left to accidental runtime failure.
- A pattern was chosen because it is fashionable rather than necessary.
- The design is more complex than the requirement demands.

Do not proceed past a hard stop. Identify the violation, explain it, fix it.

## Required Audit for Every Artifact

```
Artifact: <name>
Type: <class / method / module / etc.>
Responsibility: <one sentence>

SRP:                    Pass / Fail — reason
Single state model:     Pass / Fail — reason
Low coupling:           Pass / Fail — reason
Abstraction:            Pass / Fail — reason
Command-query:          Pass / Fail / N/A — reason
Failure safety:         Pass / Fail — reason
Open/Closed:            Pass / Fail — reason
Core protection:        Pass / Fail / N/A — reason
KISS/YAGNI:             Pass / Fail — reason
Single source of truth: Pass / Fail — reason
```

Any Fail means the artifact is not done. Fix it before submitting.

---

## Standing Prohibitions

- No `Manager`, `Helper`, `Util`, `Common`, or `Service` names unless the single responsibility is precise and explicit.
- No extension methods that hide business rules, mutate state, or couple unrelated layers.
- No business rules in controllers, repositories, DTOs, migrations, or adapters.
- No CQRS, event sourcing, mediator frameworks, or generic repository abstractions unless they provably reduce complexity for the current problem.
- No inheritance unless it is clearly simpler and safer than composition.

---

## Output Format

**Architecture proposals must include:**
1. Artifact list with one-sentence responsibilities
2. Dependency direction
3. State ownership and source of truth
4. Command / query split
5. Failure-handling strategy
6. Extensibility points — only where justified now
7. What was intentionally left out and why

**Code submissions must include:**
1. Code
2. Per-artifact rule audit
3. Trade-offs
4. Rejected alternatives and why they were rejected

The goal is simple, enforceable, correct software. Every rule above is a red line. Treat it accordingly.
